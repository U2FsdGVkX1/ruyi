# NOTE: This file is adapted from ruyi-litester/suites/ruyi.yaml, to account
# for the unique needs of GitHub Actions and PR checks.
#
# Main change points:
#
# * The default (first) test suite name is renamed to "ruyi-gha" from "ruyi".
# * Removed `ruyi/ruyi-bin-{install,remove}` pre- and post-actions because
#   we are the upstream.
# * Removed the `ruyi-bin` variant, same reason as above.
#
# Please keep the changes in sync when you bump the ruyi-litester submodule.
